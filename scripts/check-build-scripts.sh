# Verifies that no crate in the dependency tree runs code at build or compile
# time without having been reviewed.
#
# Cargo has no allowlist for this. A build script runs arbitrary code during
# `cargo build`, and a proc macro runs arbitrary code during compilation,
# neither with any sandbox and neither opt-out-able. This script is the
# allowlist.
#
# It asks cargo, through `cargo metadata`, which targets it would build,
# rather than reading manifests itself. Two earlier versions of this check
# each trusted a proxy and each had a hole:
#
#   - globbing for a file named build.rs misses a crate that points `build`
#     somewhere else, which two of the first crates we evaluated did
#     (`binding_rust/build.rs`, `bindings/rust/build.rs`);
#   - grepping manifests for a `build = ` line misses the opposite case, a
#     crate with no `build` key at all that ships a build.rs, which cargo
#     detects on its own and runs. It also missed `build="x"`,
#     `package.build`, `proc_macro = true` and `crate-type = ["proc-macro"]`.
#
# Cargo's own answer has neither problem, because it is the list cargo acts on.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-build-scripts.sh
#        scripts/check-build-scripts.sh --from <metadata.json>   (for testing)
# Requires: jq, and vendor/ to exist (run scripts/vendor.sh first), so that
# the answer describes the vendored sources and needs no network.
